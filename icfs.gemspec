    ICFS is a case management and filing system, developed for investigative
    cases, but generally applicable to many types of work. It provides a
    structured way to store and retrieve information, a case-focused access
    control scheme which can integrate into existing identity and access
    management systems, a flexible way to manage and track work assignments,
    and a way to gather statistics which is flexible and can be audited.'
